To change the countdown time, press the UP & DOWN buttons together.<br/>

Now change the seconds and press START/STOP again.<br/>
If other knowledge, repeat the previous steps, if you are ready press START/STOP to start the countdown.<br/>
If the time was different from the previous one Arduino had in EEPROM, the word Set will appear on the screen first,<br/>
the new time in EEPROM will be saved and then the reverse will start.
